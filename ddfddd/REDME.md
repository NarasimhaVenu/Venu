## Description:
Electronic_accessory_tpe_t (Light_Bulb, Fan and Fridge) must be implemented as object.

Smart Switch must have TWO types of controls - ON/OFF and Regulator

Regulator_value mapped to user defined states  (Ex: fan speed or fridge temp or light brightness, It can be the values of  0 - 10, 0 - Totally off, 10 - Full speed, brightness, and high temp etc.)

#### Each device must have unique ID.
Smart Switch Smart Switch is a free application launched in 2015,offered in desktop or mobile version. Data transfer can be done wirelessly or via a USB connector. Smart Switch also includes restore and backup functions, synchronization of data between several devices as well as software updates with the computer version. The transferred files remain intact on the original device after the transfer.

Smart Bulb A smart bulb is an internet-capable LED light bulb that allows lighting to be customized, scheduled and controlled remotely. Smart bulbs are among the most immediately successful offerings in the growing category of home automation and IoT products.

Smart Refrigirator A Smart refrigerator, also known as internet refrigerator, is a refrigerator which is able to communicate with the internet. This kind of refrigerator is often equipped to determine itself whenever a food item needs to be replenished.
